In my commuting time I try to listen to some podcasts and audiobooks.
However the car CD player is basic and can't search within tracks.
So a five minutes track would be awesome to scroll through it and
restart to listen where I was before.

It just works. At least in linux.

It will use mencoder to convert from mp3 ou ogg to WAV and creates a TOC
file for cdrdao. Thena just use cdrdao to save de CD.
